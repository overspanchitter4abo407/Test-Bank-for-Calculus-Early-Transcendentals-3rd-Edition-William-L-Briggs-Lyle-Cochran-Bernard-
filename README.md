### Product Details:


* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0134763645
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0134763644
  * * Author:  William L. Briggs, Lyle Cochran, Bernard Gillett, Eric Schulz
   
  * The much-anticipated 3rd Edition of Briggs’ Calculus Series retains its hallmark features while introducing important advances and refinements. Briggs, Cochran, Gillett, and Schulz build from a foundation of meticulously crafted exercise sets, then draw students into the narrative through writing that reflects the voice of the instructor. Examples are stepped out and thoughtfully annotated, and figures are designed to teach rather than simply supplement the narrative. The groundbreaking eBook contains approximately 700 Interactive Figures that can be manipulated to shed light on key concepts.
